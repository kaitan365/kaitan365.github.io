Welcome to my website! I'm a 5th-year Ph.D. student in [Department of Statistics](https://statistics.rutgers.edu/) at [Rutgers University](https://newbrunswick.rutgers.edu/). I am very fortunate to have [Pierre C. Bellec](https://statweb.rutgers.edu/PCB71/) as my advisor. 
My research interests span a wide range of areas in **Statistics** and **Machine Learning**, including high dimensional statistical inference, dimension reduction, and causal inference. Specifically, 
I develop tools for **uncertainty quantification** of iterative algorithms (e.g. estimating prediction risks and constructing confidence intervals for parameters of interest), to improve the reliability of statistical machine learning methods.

<!-- **I am currently on the job market for the 2024-2025 cycle and would welcome the opportunity to discuss potential positions. Please feel free to reach out via email at kai.tan@rutgers.edu.** -->
